# Mini Data Structures Project with Spring Boot

This repository contains a mini Java project that explores several fundamental data structures such as Stack, Queue, Binary Trees and Graphs, along with a visual presentation using Spring Boot. In addition, I tried to demonstrate some REST API concepts that I have learned over these days.

## Implemented Data Structures
### Stack
A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) approach, where the last element inserted is the first to be removed.

### Queue
A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) approach, where the first element inserted is the first to be removed.

### Binary Trees
A hierarchical data structure with nodes, where each node has at most two children: the left child and the right child.

### Graph
A data structure that represents a set of vertices and edges, where the edges connect the vertices.

## How to Run the Project
 1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
 2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
 3. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
 4. Run the application using the main class or through Maven with the following command: <b>mvn spring-boot:run</b>
 5.  Access the application at http://localhost:8080.

I hope this project will be a useful source of learning about data structures and their application in Java.
